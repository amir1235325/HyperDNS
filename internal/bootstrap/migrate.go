// Before v2.2.0 the compiled default was allow_all=true and no record was ever
// stored until an operator touched the toggle, so a long-running install can
// sit on "no allow_all row at all" while genuinely meaning public mode. The
// v2.2.0 default is the opposite (unknown sources refused), and the user has
// decided an upgrading install follows it: the migration forces one write of
// allow_all=false and marks it done.
//
// Ordering guarantees, given the effect-first/marker-second write pair:
//
//   - Crash before the allow_all write: nothing changed; next boot retries.
//   - Crash between the two writes: allow_all=false is already correct; the
//     missing marker only causes one harmless rewrite of the same value.
//   - After the marker: never touched again — including by a later downgrade,
//     because the marker, not the version, is the gate.
//
// An operator who wants public mode back flips the dashboard toggle, which
// writes its own row; from then on the DB record wins over every default.
